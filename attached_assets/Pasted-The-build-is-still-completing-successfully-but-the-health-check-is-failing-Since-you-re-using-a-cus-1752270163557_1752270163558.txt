The build is still completing successfully but the health check is failing. Since you're using a custom Dockerfile and the cached build is very fast, the issue is definitely in your server configuration.

Here's what you need to check:

## 1. **Check Your Dockerfile CMD/ENTRYPOINT**
Make sure your Dockerfile ends with the correct command to start your server:

```dockerfile
# Add this at the end of your Dockerfile
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

## 2. **Verify Your Server File**
Check your `dist/server.js` or `server/simple-production.js` file. It should:

```javascript
// Make sure it listens on Railway's PORT
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Bind to 0.0.0.0, not localhost
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## 3. **Check Railway Service Settings**
1. Go to your Railway service dashboard
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Under "Networking", verify:
   - **Port**: Should match what your app listens on (usually from `process.env.PORT`)
   - **Health Check Path**: Should be `/` (or change your app to respond to this path)

## 4. **Add a Health Check Route**
Ensure your server responds to the root path:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});

// Or if you're using Express with other routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'healthy', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});
```

## 5. **Check Application Logs**
This is crucial - check your Railway deployment logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click on "Deployments"
4. Click on the failed deployment
5. Check both "Deploy Logs" and "App Logs"

The App Logs will show you exactly why your server isn't starting or responding.

## 6. **Test Your Built Server Locally**
Since you're using esbuild, test the exact file Railway is trying to run:

```bash
# Build your project
npm run build
npx esbuild server/simple-production.js --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/server.js --allow-overwrite

# Test the built server
PORT=3000 node dist/server.js
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` to see if it responds.

## 7. **Common Issues:**
- **Missing environment variables** - Railway might need specific env vars
- **Database connection issues** - If your app connects to a DB on startup
- **Import/export issues** - Since you're using ESM format
- **Async startup code** - Server might be crashing during initialization

**The key is checking those Railway App Logs** - they'll tell you exactly what's going wrong when your server tries to start.
