# Contributing to ZEMA

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ZEMA as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Add proper TypeScript types for all props and functions

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Use TypeScript for all server code
- Follow RESTful API conventions
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Maintain proper authentication middleware

### Database
- Use Drizzle ORM schema definitions
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Include migration scripts for schema changes
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test UI components with React Testing Library
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples in your documentation

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and benefits
- Possible implementation approach
- Screenshots or mockups if applicable

## License
