## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for ZEMA (Zero Effort Mail Automation), an email automation service with the tagline "Zero Effort Mail Automation". The project is built with a modern tech stack featuring a React frontend with TypeScript, an Express.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM. The application serves as a comprehensive email automation platform, allowing users to request demos and subscribe to newsletters.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client-side and server-side code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling, ESBuild for backend compilation
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for demo requests and newsletter subscriptions
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Storage**: Abstract storage interface with in-memory implementation for development
- **Development Setup**: Vite integration for hot module replacement

### Database Schema
The application uses two main tables:
- `demo_requests`: Stores user demo requests with fields for name, email, company, and message
- `newsletters`: Manages email subscriptions with unique email constraint

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/demo-request`: Create new demo request
- `GET /api/demo-requests`: Retrieve all demo requests (admin endpoint)
- `POST /api/newsletter`: Subscribe to newsletter
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes and validation

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the landing page components (hero, features, pricing, etc.)
2. **Form Submission**: Demo requests and newsletter subscriptions are handled through React forms
3. **API Communication**: Frontend uses TanStack Query to communicate with Express.js backend
4. **Data Validation**: Zod schemas validate incoming data on both client and server
5. **Storage**: Validated data is stored using the storage interface (currently in-memory, designed for database integration)
6. **Response**: Success/error responses are displayed to users via toast notifications

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components for accessible UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **HTTP Client**: Built-in fetch API with TanStack Query wrapper
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Hookform Resolvers
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date utilities

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Session Management**: Express session with PostgreSQL store (connect-pg-simple)
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite for frontend, ESBuild for backend
- **Linting**: TypeScript compiler for type checking
- **Development Server**: Integrated Vite dev server with Express middleware

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for production deployment with:

1. **Build Process**: 
   - Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
   - Backend: ESBuild compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Development: Uses tsx for TypeScript execution with Vite middleware
   - Production: Serves static files and runs compiled JavaScript

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Uses Drizzle Kit for database migrations
   - Configured for PostgreSQL with environment-based connection string

4. **Replit Integration**:
   - Configured with Replit-specific plugins for development
   - Runtime error overlay for debugging
   - Cartographer plugin for development insights
