# Railway Deployment Trigger

This file forces Railway to rebuild without using cached layers.

**Build Timestamp**: 2025-01-11 21:43 UTC
**Trigger Reason**: FIXED ES MODULE CONFLICT
**Changes**: 
- Fixed CommonJS/ES module conflict by renaming server to .cjs extension
- Server tested locally and responds correctly to health checks
- Updated Dockerfile and railway.json to use server.cjs
- Health check endpoint returns proper JSON response
- Server binds to 0.0.0.0 and uses Railway's PORT environment variable

**Expected Result**: Successful deployment with passing health checks
