# Railway Deployment Trigger

This file forces Railway to rebuild without using cached layers.

**Build Timestamp**: 2025-01-11 21:38 UTC
**Trigger Reason**: FORCE COMPLETE CACHE BREAK
**Changes**: 
- Changed base image from node:18-alpine to node:18-slim
- New working directory `/zema-prod` 
- CommonJS server (server/direct-production.js) - no ES modules
- Startup script approach with ./start.sh
- Simplified build process with built-in frontend build

**Expected Result**: Complete cache break and successful deployment
